# Why Poetry?
- it is simple & easy to configure
- can create env, add dependencies, clean env
- automates many processes
- deals with virtual env, manages dependencies AND can publish packages to Pypi 
- fast & efficient - it uses a lock file, so we do not have to reinstall dependencies. 

# Example
1. pip install --upgrade pip
2. pip install poetry
3. create a pyproject.toml file 
   ^ this can be automatically generated by calling:
     "poetry init"
4. get metadata on Virtual Environment via: 
     "poetry env info"
5. create the virtual environment in cwd():
     "poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true"
     "poetry install"
   activate virtual environment & subsequently open a new shell:
     "poetry shell"
   de-activate venv:
     "deactivate"
6. add dependencies
     "poetry add <package name>"
   remove dependencies
     "poetry remov <package name>"
7. list all environments
     "poetry env list"
